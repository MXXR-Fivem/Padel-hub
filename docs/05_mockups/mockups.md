# Mockups 

For the mockups we used Figma and based on the ideas and the wireframes we choose to to have a minimalist design with color matching and easy to understand UI.

<div style="display:flex; gap:12px; align-items:flex-start; flex-wrap:wrap;">
  <img src="../04_wireframes/assets/login.png" width="100%">

  The login/register page is modern and minimalist to make it easier to use

  <img src="../04_wireframes/assets/mainmenu.png" width="75%">

  The main menu is detailed and colorful while keeping the navigation bar and the header in a modern design with the key color being the green/yellow of the logo #92c650

  <img src="../04_wireframes/assets/coach.png" width="75%">
  <img src="../04_wireframes/assets/court.png" width="100%">

  Both "find a court" and "find a coach" are very important for the app, its the key role of the application and need to be easy to handle and very user friendly ( with big button, map to plan the match easily , ect)

  <img src="../04_wireframes/assets/ranking.png" width="100%">

  Ranking is a siple page needed in padel where the international padel federation rules the ranking.

  <img src="../04_wireframes/assets/profile.png" width="100%">

  The profile page is similar to other social media profile page, its here to easily handle links between users and is also used for the feed part of the app
