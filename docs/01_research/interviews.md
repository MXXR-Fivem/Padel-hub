## Notes from discussions with classmates (3 structured interviews)

Goal: highlight needs, frustrations, habits and expectations.  
We only talked with classmates who already played padel.

Main question to start the discussion:  
**"What do you think about an all-in-one app that puts everything about padel in one place?"**
