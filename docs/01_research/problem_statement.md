## Problem Statement

Padel is growing so fast, but the player experience is still fragile. Today, a padel player usually needs multiple tools to do simple things: book a court on one platform, create a match in a group chat, find missing players on another app, track results manually, and discover clubs/events on the social media part .

This creates some problems:
- Organizing a match is hard because you need 4 players and people often cancel.
- Skill levels are unclear, so matches can be unbalanced and less fun.
- Information is scattered (courts, prices, schedules, players, events, gear), so users waste time switching between apps.

Padel.hub solves this by providing one centralized platform where players can book, create/join games, find players, communicate, track matches, discover content and purchase products in one place.
