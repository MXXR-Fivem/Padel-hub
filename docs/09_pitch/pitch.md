# Padel.hub
## The padel-only social + booking platform

**Scroll less noise. Play more padel.**  
A padel-only feed connected to bookings, coaching, and real sessions.

**Product Design + MVP**  
Short content • Community • Booking


---

# Problem
## Padel players are spread across too many apps.

- Padel is fragmented: Instagram/TikTok for clips, Strava for activity, separate apps/sites for court booking, coaches, and gear.
- Generic feeds optimize for low-quality engagement, not for sport progression or real-life action.
- Planning a game is messy: switching between DMs, group chats, links, and booking screens.

### Design challenge
Build a focused social web app for short content and interactions, within a constrained MVP scope.

# Target users
## People who play padel and want everything in one place.

### Beginner (0–6 months)
- Wants rules, tactics, and simple drills.
- Needs nearby courts and beginner-friendly coaching.
- Wants to follow padel creators without distractions.

### Social player (weekly)
- Books courts with friends.
- Uses DMs and group chats to organize games.
- Wants a padel-only feed + match highlights.

### Coach / Club
- Wants visibility and direct booking requests.
- Posts short tips and sessions.
- Builds community and retention.

# Concept
## A padel-first social layer connected to real-world action.

- Padel-only feed: short posts (text, links, clips) with tags (beginner, strategy, gear, local).
- Booking hub: search and reserve courts + request coaches (MVP demo flow).
- Activity posts: share sessions like a Strava entry (duration, location, notes).
- Knowledge hub: rules, strategies, drills — quick cards to save and share.
- Social: DMs + groups to plan games; invite friends and coordinate in-app.
- Shop: curated gear catalog linked from content (MVP: browse-only).

**Healthy scrolling: only padel content, with a purpose.**

# UX walkthrough
## Key flow from scroll → booking → play → share.

1. **Onboard** — Pick level, city, and interests.
2. **Padel feed** — Scroll padel-only content.
3. **Book** — Open a court/coach card and book.
4. **Invite** — Share booking to a group and confirm players.
5. **Play** — Reminders + quick rules/strategy cards.
6. **Post** — Share a recap: score, notes, clip/link.

# MVP scope
## A minimal web-based prototype demonstrating the key loop.

### Included in MVP
- Auth + basic profiles 
- Feed 
- Court/coach card + booking demo (mocked availability).
- Groups: create + invite friends + share booking.
- Knowledge cards: rules + simple strategies (save/share).
- Shop: curated catalog view (no checkout).

### Out of scope (for now)
- Payments and real integration with every club.
- Real-time chat, calls, or advanced moderation.
- Full recommendation engine and creator monetization.
- Inventory, shipping, returns (full e-commerce).
- Advanced analytics and wearable data sync.

### MVP success = one complete loop
Discover padel content → book a session → invite friends → post a recap (inside Padel.hub).
